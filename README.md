- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JunnXiann
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and AI Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) in the Universiti Malaya.

I first started my CS journey aspiring to be an ML Engineer but chose to take SE instead because of the immature market of AI in Malaysia.
So i've decided to go for SE and sharpen my coding fundamentals, ML can be self-learned if im good at coding anyways.
